        <h1>MUHAMMAD ZAFRAN</h1>
        <p>This is Muhammad Zafran, I pursued my master's degree in Computer Science from University of Lincoln, United Kingdom and availed myself for services. As an experienced software engineer and programmer, I am able to understand problems clearly, break them down into hypotheses, and propose solutions in a coherent manner. I can understand concepts quickly, or ask the right questions to help make everything clear, and don't need to have everything written down in a specifications document. I rate myself very good in Researching, designing, implementing, and managing software programs.</p>
